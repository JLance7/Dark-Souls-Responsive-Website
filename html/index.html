                    &nbsp &nbsp I'm glad you asked, Dark souls is a video game series developed by FromSoftware. The director of the series is Hidetaki Miyazaki.
                    The game is based around a medieval RPG setting where players must overcome great odds by defeating tough enemies, bosses, and demons.
                    The first game in the series was called Demon Souls. Then there is Dark Souls released in 2011, Dark Souls 2/Scholar of the First Sin released in
                    2014, and Dark Souls 3 released in 2016. FromSoftware has been widely praised for their innovative and beautifully terrifying environments they
                    bring to life. The company has received widespread recognition for their work. FromSoftware has also made a few more "soul-type" games like
                    Bloodborne released in 2015 and Sekiro released in 2019. The studio has been working on an upcoming game called Elden Ring that many people are excited
                    for and is said to be released in early 2021.

                <h2>What does it mean to praise the sun?</h2>

                    <p style="font-size: 25px; color: #ff3856;">&nbsp &nbspA famous quote from the series is to praise the sun. This comes from a character in the first game named Solaire who
                        says this and then puts his arms up in the air as to show appreciation for it. "The sun is a wondrous body, like a magnificent father!
                        If only I could be so grossly incandescent." -Solaire It is an expression of relief, delight, or gratitude, often used humorously and
                        accompanied with uplifted arms.

                    <p style="font-size: 25px; color: #ff3856;">&nbsp &nbspThe series is celebrated and embraced by fans. It tells a story of overcoming adversary and seemingly unfair odds.
                        The common trope in these games is boss fights against large foes and dying over and over again. Throughout the game you are encouraged
                        to keep trying and to not go hollow (lose hope and give up). It is because of the challenge and the fantasy world these games take place in
                        that so many people love them.
